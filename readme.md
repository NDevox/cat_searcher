# Cat Searcher

This is a basic program based on a user defined number of cats and people.

The people/cats are randomly distributed along the tube map and have to find their cats/owners.

Cats move randomly. People try to move without returning to stations they have been to already.

Once a cat an person have found each other, The result is so intense that the station they were in has to close down
and can no longer be accessed, although those in it can leave. This means people can become trapped - which is a shame.
